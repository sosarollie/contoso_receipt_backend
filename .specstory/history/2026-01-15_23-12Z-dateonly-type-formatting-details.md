The user is asking about how the DateOnly type is formatted. They're currently viewing Receipt.cs, and since this is a .NET project (looks like ASP.NET Core based on the structure), I should check if there's a DateOnly property in the Receipt.cs file to see how it's being used/formatted.

Let me read the Receipt.cs file to see if there's a DateOnly type in use.The `DateOnly` type in your Receipt class (line 9) is formatted using the default serialization format, which is typically **"yyyy-MM-dd"** (e.g., "2026-01-15") when serialized to JSON in ASP.NET Core.

If you need to customize the format, you can use the `[JsonConverter]` attribute with a custom converter or configure it globally in your `undefined` using JSON serializer options.

The user is having issues with a Postman POST request. I need to gather more context to understand what the issue might be. Let me:

1. Check the Program.cs to see the API endpoints
2. Check if there's a .http file that might show example requests
3. Look at the ReceiptDTO to see what the expected format is for POST requests

Let me start by reading these files to understand the API structure.The issue is likely with the **DateOnly format**. Based on your code, when you send a POST request to `/receipts`, the `Receipt_date` field needs to be formatted as **"yyyy-MM-dd"** (e.g., "2026-01-15").

Here's the correct JSON format for your POST request in Postman:

```json
{
    "receipt_date": "2026-01-15",
    "total_amount": 99.99,
    "proper_name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "name": "Store Name"
}
```

**Common issues:**

1. **Date format** - Must be "yyyy-MM-dd" (ISO format). Wrong formats like "01/15/2026" or "15-01-2026" will fail.

2. **Property naming** - JSON uses camelCase by default, so use `receipt_date` (lowercase 'r') in the JSON body.

3. **Content-Type header** - Make sure you set `Content-Type: application/json` in Postman headers.

4. **URL** - POST to `http://localhost:5000/receipts`

What specific error message are you getting in Postman?
